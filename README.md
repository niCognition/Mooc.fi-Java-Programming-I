# Mooc.fi-solutions

In this repository I will be posting my solutions to the exercises in the course Java Programming 1.
The course and other courses can be found at https://www.mooc.fi/en/

# Where are all the files??

Most of the exercises have test-files and Maven dependencies etc. wich I've taken the liberty of removing.
I'm only posting my solutions here. If you'd like to see more then head over to https://java-programming.mooc.fi/
In the exercises where I've created tests there are tests added to the commits.
